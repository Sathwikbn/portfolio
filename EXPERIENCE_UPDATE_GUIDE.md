## üé® Tips for Writing Great Experience Entries

### **Description**
- Keep it 2-3 sentences
- Focus on your main responsibilities
- Use action verbs (developed, implemented, designed, etc.)

**Example:**
```typescript
description: "Developed responsive web applications using React and Node.js. Collaborated with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality software solutions. Implemented modern development practices and contributed to code reviews."
```

### **Achievements**
- Use specific numbers when possible
- Focus on impact and results
- Start with action verbs

**Good Examples:**
```typescript
achievements: [
    "Developed 5+ responsive web applications serving 10,000+ users",
    "Reduced page load time by 40% through code optimization",
    "Collaborated with 3-person team to deliver projects on time",
    "Implemented automated testing reducing bugs by 60%"
]
```

**Avoid:**
```typescript
achievements: [
    "Worked on projects", // Too vague
    "Learned new technologies", // Not an achievement
    "Helped with development" // Not specific
]
```

### **Technologies**
- List the main technologies you used
- Include frameworks, languages, tools
- Keep it relevant to the role

**Example:**
```typescript
technologies: ["React", "TypeScript", "Node.js", "MongoDB", "AWS", "Git", "Docker"]
```

## üîÑ Ordering Your Experiences

**Newest experiences should be at the TOP of the array** (index 0).

```typescript
const experiences = [
    // NEWEST EXPERIENCE (most recent)
    {
        company: "Current Company",
        role: "Current Role",
        duration: "2024 - Present",
        // ... rest of details
    },
    // PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE
    {
        company: "Previous Company",
        role: "Previous Role", 
        duration: "2023 - 2024",
        // ... rest of details
    },
    // OLDEST EXPERIENCE (at the bottom)
    {
        company: "First Company",
        role: "First Role",
        duration: "2022 - 2023",
        // ... rest of details
    }
];
```

## üöÄ After Adding New Experience

1. **Test locally**: Run `npm run dev` and check the experience page
2. **Verify all links work**: Test company website, LinkedIn, certificate links
3. **Check mobile view**: Ensure it looks good on mobile devices
4. **Deploy**: Push changes and redeploy to Vercel

## üì± Example: Adding a New Job

Let's say you got a job at "TechCorp" as a "Frontend Developer":

```typescript
